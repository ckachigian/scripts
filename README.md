# scripts
These are some scripts that I have found useful over time.  I am in the process of cleaning up the scripts and publishing.  I will also use this as an opportunity to sharpen my PowerShell skills since its been a few years since Iâ€™ve had to do anything meaningful with PowerShell.  Thanks for your patience and I hope you find the contents useful.

New goal for the PowerShell Scripts: ensure the scripts work well when run both synchronously and asynchronously.  This is something I will add to the scripts over time.

**Testing on Windows based systems**  
Open PowerShell and set the execution policy:  
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted  
```
Test script execution  
Review output  
Fix errors then recheck  
Publish when correct  

**Testing on MacOS based systems**  
Open terminal  
Test script execution  
Review output  
Fix errors then recheck  
Publish when correct  

**Testing on Linux Systems**  
Open terminal  
Test script execution  
Review output  
Fix errors then recheck  
Publish when correct  

My intention is to get a automated test system in place at some point as time allows.  As of now I am testing manually.
