# scripts
These are some scripts that I have found useful over time.  I am in the process of cleaning up the scripts and publishing.  I will also use this as an opportunity to sharpen my script skills since its been a few years since I’ve had to do anything meaningful with scripts.  Thanks for your patience and I hope you find the contents useful.


Goals of this project:
- Deliver a projects that’s useful to the community
- Sharpen and enhance my scripting skills
- For the PowerShell Scripts: ensure the scripts work well when run both synchronously and asynchronously.  This is something I will add to the scripts over time.
- Ensure Script output is consistent across Windows, MacOS and Linux.  This will help for use in 3rd party systems or when needing a standard output from programmatic use, ie: APIs. This should also reduce the need for output manipulation.


**Testing on Windows based systems**  
Open PowerShell and set the execution policy:  
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted  
```
Test script execution  
Review output  
Fix errors then recheck  
Publish when correct  

**Testing on MacOS based systems**  
- Open terminal  
- Test script execution  
- Review output  
- Fix errors then recheck  
- Publish when correct  

**Testing on Linux Systems**  
- Open terminal  
- Test script execution  
- Review output  
- Fix errors then recheck  
- Publish when correct  

My intention is to get a automated test system in place at some point as time allows.  As of now I am testing manually.
