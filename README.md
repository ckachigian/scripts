Testing on Windows based systems
Open PowerShell and set the execution policy:
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Testing on MacOS based systems

Testing on Linux Systems

My intention is to get a automated test system in place at some point as time allows.  As of now I am testing manually.
